 # Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise has set out to raise funds to support her play, Fever. There are other plays and projects that were in positions to raise funds to launch their projects successfully. Louise wants to get a sense of how she measures when compared to others.

### Purpose
This project compilation is to help Louise visualize how other campaigns did based on their launch date and goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges
In order for me to gain information and insight into the other projects and help Louise answer her question, I had to first get the data into a format that would help specifically to what was being asked. To answer her first question on what were the outcomes of projects based on Launch date, I had to organize the data. I used a pivot table to essentially tease out Outcomes, Subcategories, and launch dates to answer this question. I had to calculate other data components to essentially get to what I needed. 

The other question that was asked is did the goals set have any bearing on the outcome of the project, specifically the subcategory of plays.  In order to get this information, I had to take the current data , filter and calculate other dimensions such as % of out comes to Total projects and subdivided  the goals into measurable brackets. The challenge here was trying to successfully get the goals into brackets. I did this by using a countify function that helped with grouping the specific criteria I needed. 

My major challenge that I had was calculating the brackets and getting the chart to show the correct outcome to vs goals configuration. To get it to work, I used a pivot table to first pull down the goals based on brackets then the % Total of each outcome. From there a did a pivot chart to get to the right graphs. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date 
On the analysis for Outcomes Based on Launch date, we used the Parent Category for theater for all years 2009 - 2017. Based on what I go through there were particular months through the years that were better for launching a project than others. I found that there was more success with a project launched during the summer months than in the winter. May and June stood out as the best months to launch the projects overall. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on the data for Outcomes vs. fundraising goals that were set, I found that the fundraising goals for plays less than 5000 were more successful than those where the goal was set higher than 50,000. There seemed to be a higher fail rate for those plays. More interesting was that the fail rate for plays with a fundraising goal set between 45,000 and 49,000 was almost 100%. This is only when looking at the total of projects for Plays and not any other subcategory. The challenge is that there is not a complete look at all projects and their fundraising goals to get a big picture. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Limitations of the data were that dimensions that were needed to get to some of the questions had to calculated or added. The challenge would be to make sure that the calculations and added data make sense to the information you are trying to gather and can be relatable.  Trying to bracket the goals using the count if function was a challenge in that I had to make sure my greater and less than signs limited the count to picking up in between the two data points. 

## Results

Conclusions made about the Theater out comes is that the more successful projects in the Theater group were launched during the summer months especially in May, and more projects failed at the beginning of the fall and winter months when launched in September and November. 

Conclusion made about the Outcomes based on Goals is that overall it appears that plays whose goals are less than 1000 tend to have more success than any other goal bracket. So how much you raise doesn't impact whether you succeed or fail. 

Overall limitations are how we parse the data to answer questions and if it is giving us a complete picture without having to add other parameters to answer the questions. 

Other possible data sets and graphs that could be used to answer questions are Launch date vs. success. vs goals. Is there a particular month where the goals were met when the amount was higher or lower? What other category where the goals were high did they have high success, lower success? Which month were there high fundraising goals?
